The Script Editor, or sometimes also referred to as the **Lunaris Editor**, allows you to write code in the Lunaris programming language. This page goes in depth on how to get the most out of the Script Editor. If you want to learn more about Lunaris, then go to the (link to Lunaris manual page).

## Customization
Each programmer has their own preferences while writing code. Whether it is the tabs vs spaces (#tabs 4 life) discussion, font size, colors, or even the font that you are coding in. Whatever you prefer, you can configure it in the Script Editor. To change your preferences for the Script Editor, head over to the Mod Editor and select the Options menu.
