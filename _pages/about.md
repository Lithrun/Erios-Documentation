## Projects

### Erios the Game

Since August 2022 I have been working towards a so called vertical slice demo. This is a short demo, yet one that will showcase most of the features within the game. This can give potential players a good feel whether or not they will like the end product, allows me to gather valuable feedback, and also to start making estimates towards potential release dates.

### The Books of Erios

Since 2015 I have been writing a book series called "Erios". Most of my writings for Erios are still unpublished to this date, but once I become satisfied and gather the confidence, I will publish them. See Lore for more information

## Project History

### October 2015
Concept of creating a game in RPG maker, it was called "The Hunters: Battle of the Clans". It had a simple plot plot about a war between 5 clans The Hunters, The Ruby Rangers, The Azure Company, The Army of ... (It was never given a name in that concept) and the Desert Clan.

Within the Erios fantasy universe, the Hunters, Ruby Rangers and Azure Company still exist. "The Army of ..." later became The Silver Forge, and the Desert Clan became the Kingdoms of Dorolin. A game was never created given my inexperience in both game development and programming at the time.

### 2017
I still wanted to create this game, but there wasn't enough lore behind it. So I decided to write a fantasy book called "Erios". I wrote out a complete chapter, which is now known as Chapter I: The Silver Kings. Act II: The Sons of Duilin

### 2019
Here and there I was writing Erios, coming up with new ideas and concepts, and adding them into the lore. Every month the story got more and more detailed, and so did its fantasy world grow. By this time I had written 268 page of story (115k words), but also expended upon the story by adding two prequels. Each prequal would explain the background behind the two major factions, on why they are in conflict within the main story. These were called Erios: Lone Wolf and Erios: The Silver Sword. Although both of these prequels have been finished since 2019, they were never published.

Adding further to the story, I also organized the story within Chapters and Acts. Each chapter would consist of multiple acts, and each act is roughly 40-50 pages in size. At the end of that year, I also finished most of the story behind Chapter I: The Silver Kings. Act I: Weldanar. The story of this game will primarily take place within events that occur during this act.

### 2020
At this year, I already had 4 years of experience in programming, and a full year of working within a software development company. I was doing my graduation internship in New Zealand, and with having a lot of free time available, I focused more on Erios. The story was really starting to get in a good shape, and I wanted to create a game based on Chapter I: The Silver Kings. Act I: Weldanar. I decided that I could create this game within the Unity Engine, given my experience as a fullstack software developer with C#.

I did however not having the required game developer experience, as I was only experienced within desktop & web development. So I needed to gain experience before I could take on the task of finally creating my own game, so I created a project called AoTTG2. AoTTG2 is an open-source continuation of the popular game called AoTTG2. To this day, it is still under development by the community.

### August 2022
Time flew by during the corona pandemic. Just not much interesting had happened, I mainly stayed indoors due to all of the lock downs. During my solo trip to France, I could finally clear my mind again and explore the world. And found my passion again for Erios. I started writing again, and during my trip in France I decided that now it is time to work on Erios as a game.

I created a detailed game design document, and when I came back after my trip in France I started to prototype in my free-time.

### 2023
To this day, I am still prototyping Erios. I want to test out each system and concept within the game design document, and see how well it cooperates with the other systems. As designing something is one thing, best way to see if it actually works is to just implement it.

In March I will move to Japan for a year, and during my trip there I will have a lot of free time to keep prototyping and testing out ideas.

### September 2023
After a year of prototyping, a decision was made to switch to a different game engine. Previously I used the Unity Engine, yet due to an announcement from Unity by wanting to charge a so called runtime fee and to include installation trackers, I've decided to change game engines. I've decided to use the Godot game engine. The work I've done on the past year on the demo isn't lost, as I can move over a lot of my work from Unity to Godot. It doesn't take as much time as starting from scratch, but it will still take some months for me to get used to the new game engine.


## The Developer

Hi, my online name is Lithrun and my offline name is Nick, and I'm a (current year - 1998) year old software developer from the Netherlands. Working on Erios has been a childhood dream, and since 2022 I have been working towards a demo of the game. I will need to add more information here, and probably I will forget to do so... Now this is awkward... Please send me a message so I can correct it...
