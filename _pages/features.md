# Roadmap

In 2024 I want to publicly announce the project. During the announcement, a playable demo will be available within a single region of the game, called "Hergen". This will be a so called "vertical-slice" demo, which means that it will feature all major mechanics & systems, but that they are applied on a small scale. Based on the results of this demo, some adjustments will be made based on the feedback.

At the end of the year, I also plan to start a kickstarter. As when the vertical-slice demo is done, I will be able to estimate how much time I will need to invest to create a full-game and also how much it will cost. Although as an indie developer I will not have to pay any permanent employees, I would still have to hire some artists to create music and concept art for the game. The demo will also be included within the kickstarter so before people will back the game, they can try it out and see if this is a game that they want to invest their money in or not.

After this point, it's hard to make any estimates. If the kickstarter would succeed, then it means that I would be able to work full-time on Erios. A dream coming true. If the kickstarter would fail, then I would still continue on working on Erios, but the time that I can dedicate towards the project would be limited as I'd still need to work a full-time job in order to afford the bills.
