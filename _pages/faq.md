# General

## 
- This is the answer of question 1



# Multiplayer

## Q: Question 2
- This is the answer of question 2

# Mods

## What type of mods can I make?
- With mods you can extend further upon the game. So think about adding new AI behavior to NPCs, new NPCs, new quests, new areas and new items. Mod support is available in LUA

# Books

## When will the books be released?
- Hard to tell, my main focus is currently on developing Erios as a game, so progression on writing goes fairly slowly. Given that I have several chapters planned, perhaps I will release them per chapter as finishing the whole story is a life long journey.

## Will there be physical copies of the Erios book series?
- Once I have finished writing the books, I do plan on finding a publisher so that physical copies can be sold. There will also be an e-book version.
