"Behind Erios", perhaps the start of a series to explore a bit more about the lore and story of the world, rather than exclusively showing game progression. As besides working on the game, behind the scenes I am still expanding the world of Erios with more details and stories.

## Weldanar

It's often mentioned that the game takes place in Weldanar, yet where is Weldanar exactly?

Well, it's here. South of Êddan, West of Hagsponar and North of Azûrlin. Each of these mentioned regions are interesting on their own, yet for now these will be out of scope for the game. Hopefully one day in the future players can explore these other regions, yet for now, the game will just take place in Weldanar. Don't worry tho, as Weldanar is a massive region in itself.

Perhaps in the next "Behind Erios" blog I should go further into depth for Weldanar, but let's just move on to the title of this post. The blue apples.

## Why are there blue apples?

Blue apples? Well yeah, they do actually exist in Erios. Not by the name of "Blue apples" however, they are called "Hergian Apples". A rare type of apple which only exists near the town of Hergen, in the Helmanar sub-region of Weldanar.

As with most things in Erios, there is a story and reason why these exist. Let's just look at the official lore reason behind these Hergian Apples. Previously I wrote Erios in a massive word document, but since I ended up with dozens of documents and hundreds of pages which became hard to maintain and consistent, I switched to "Obsidian". Basically, it allows you to create pages, which you can very easily link to other pages. Great application, would recommend it to anyone who is an author.

## The origin behind the blue apple

As some of you may know, I'm from the Netherlands, but currently I'm living in Japan. So logically, I'm also learning Japanese. One interesting thing about Japanese is that things which have the green color, sometimes use the 青 kanji. Which is the kanji of blue. So a green apple would be 青いリンゴ which would literally translate to "Blue Apple", but logically this means a green apple. Yet, if an apple were to actually be blue, then how should it be called? Since the kanji for blue is already used for a green apple. So, I've asked my girlfriend a few times, who is Japanese, but she didn't know either. Probably ブルーリンゴ (Blue Apple in Katakana) would be the closest. Either way, because of the talk I've had with her about blue apples... Ta-da, blue apples now actually exist in Erios!

Perhaps it's silly, perhaps it's cool, either way, the blue apple is real!

## Message from the developer

Perhaps a different blog than you expected, yet I do hope that you found it interesting. If so, then I will probably create similar blogs in the future, as there is a lot more to explore and reveal about the world. Hundreds of characters, dozens of creatures, dozens of regions, and many points of interest within the world.

If you aren't part of any of the community pages yet, then I strongly advise you to join them! As updates on the community pages are much more frequent than these blogs, plus you can even message me. If you dare... I don't bite, I guess, maybe. Anyways, thanks for reading, and I will see you all at our next blog o/
