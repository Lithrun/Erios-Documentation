Erios. Now that's the name of a book that I have been writing ever since 2015. It's the name of a fantasy world that so far has only existed within my writings and mind. Yet that is going to change now. As per August 2022 I have been working towards a prototype, and now that development is starting to become more focussed towards an actual demo instead of trying out ideas, it's time to celebrate this by creating a public blog post. Woooo~

To be fair, it's also been the first blog post I've written myself in 2 years. I'm not really sure what the best or most professional way is to write them, I just prefer to write it in my own style. Whether that's a pro or con, depends on you I guess.

Anyways, over the last 2 weeks I've revamped this website. Previously it was just empty with a logo, well now it is filled with content! I've added the main page, Frequently Asked Questions, About and (most importantly) the features & roadmap section. The community behind Erios has been small thus far, but I'd like to welcome more people. So feel free to share this with your friends, and feel free to also share the discord & twitter page!

*Yeah, the old version of the website was really ugly and basic..*

## How's it going?

As aforementioned, I've been prototyping on Erios since August 2022, and I can say that it has been a lot of fun and I have learned a lot more about game development. Extra year of experience to add to my solo indie dev career CV. The current version of Erios has been developed in the Unity 2021 game engine. Pretty well, I can create the game that I have designed with what Unity has to offer. Great stuff. Yet things have changed since Unity announced in at the [12th of September that they wanted to introduce a so called "runtime fee"](https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates), basically charging developers whenever a user installs a game. Unity has stepped back and they have introduced a maximum % that they will charge, with lots of other adjustments, but for me personally it has damaged the trust I had in Unity severely.

I started using Unity all the way back in 2018 for a small Attack on Titan fangame known as [AoTTG](http://aotrc.weebly.com/). So that's been a good 5 years now. I do like the game engine a lot, mainly due to the fact that I can create games in C#, as that's my favorite programming language. Clean syntax, and much better than Java in my opinion. Anyways, since the announcement I have been trying out another game engine called [Godot](https://godotengine.org). Just like Unity it is a game engine, although unlike Unity, Godot is a community driven open source game engine. So ever since the announcement from Unity I have been experimenting with Godot to see if it is possible for me to switch from Unity to Godot.

*Very early prototyping with Godot*

Making a decision like this is not an easy one, as Erios is a long term commitment to me. Switching from Unity to Godot will take a lot of time, but it can also be a fun and new journey. Once I have made my decision, it will be time for another blog post. Whether it's Erios x Godot or Erios x Unity, for you it won't matter! Either way, development on Erios will continue and one day the game shall be released and playable for you!
