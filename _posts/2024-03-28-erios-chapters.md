Been a while since the last blog hasn't it? 

## Recap
To summarize what happened between the last blog post (November 2023) and today (28th of March 2024). I've moved back from Japan to the Netherlands, I became an engaged man, and implemented lots of features for Erios. On both our Twitter and Discord I have consistently provided updates for these months, but I failed to find the time to write a blog post. So what's new now in the game?

- Game's Godot version is up to date with the latest version (4.2.2-rc.2). Quite easy and quick to upgrade versions.
- Persistable user settings, so the game will remember your settings.
- Implemented a mod loader (quite basic, for now it will just scan and show your installed mods)
- Added Terrain into the game (Terrain3D)
- Made a layout for the demo region: Hergen
- Equipment system for entities (player & npc)
- Region/zone system
- Experimental: Aimed attacks. Your attacks will change direction based on where you are looking. Not sure if I will keep this, will see based on feedback.
- Design for an in-game collectable Card Game (Erios Card Game/ECG)
- Level Editor overhaul
- Low-polifier tool, which converts a high-poly object into a low-poly style object to fit Erios its art style
- Erios Dialogue Language (EDL) & NPCs making sounds while speaking

Quite a lot actually isn't it? Each of these items deserve a more in-depth description and showcase, so if you want to learn more about these: [join the community]({% link _pages/join.md %})!

## The Erios Chapters

The Erios Chapters, now that sounds cool doesn't it? Its essentially a roadmap which will make it more clear for you, the viewer, spectator, follower, awesome person, to see what I am working on. As thus far I felt like that the updates from 2024 felt random and confusing to you, so I want to make it more clearly what I am working on and why.

Within each Chapter, I will work on a set of features, and at the end of each chapter, I will publish an early-build within the Discord server, to gather feedback from you.

At this moment, I will first work on a few fundamental features that every upcoming chapter will require in some way or another. Some of these are already partially implemented, but I expect that this will take roughly a hundred hours, so depending on my work schedule, this will probably take between 1-2 months. After these fundamentals are complete, I will start working on the first chapter: The Hunter. Which will feature the Hunting skill, which allows players (and later NPCs), to hunt creatures and to either capture or kill them.

Good idea these Erios Chapters or not? Let me know!

## Message from the developer

A long wall of text isn't it? So far I am satisfied with the progress I have made since the previous blog. Unfortunately I was sick in February for a few weeks, but even despite that, I have still done lots of work in the other months. Despite that, there's still a lot more work to do. Takes time, but I am having a great time doing so.

Thank you for your ongoing support, although the community behind Erios is small, I do enjoy sharing these moments and thoughts with you. So for those who have made it this far, stay awesome, and I will see you around in the community o/
