## Community Awards

Erios is still a small community, yet it's filled already with so many interesting individuals! I'd like to thank all of you for your contributions, and in special, I have 4 awards to hand out!

### Ocean Brainstorm Machine Award
The **Ocean Brainstorm Machine Award** goes to... ArminOopsArlert!

Armin has been part of the Erios community ever since 2023, and during his time he has provided a lot of valuable insight, ideas & feedback. Sadly I have not been able to add everything we have agreed upon, yet I will do my best in 2026 to bring some of these to life! Fear not tho, as anyone is able to provide this type of feedback! You know where to find me~

### Bug Inspector Award
The **Bug Inspector Award** goes to... Barimoto!

Although Erios is not yet publicly available, it is possible to become a playtester to test out alpha builds (Details are at the discord & forum!). Bari was able to find bugs effeciently, and even provided recorded footage clearly showcasing the issue. A lot more changes will come in 2026, so let's find and destroy every bug!

### Emotional Support Award
The **Emotional Support Award** goes to... my wife! Erios has taken away time we could have spent together. Whether it is a movie night, another museum or whatever we want to do. Finding the right balance is still a struggle for me. Yet regardless, you always support me and are here when I need you.  ありがとう！

### The special award
The **Special Award** goes to... you!

Yes really, you! Anti-climatic, yet I'd like to personally thank you for being part of the Erios community. We are on a good track in terms of progression and features, and soon enough we will be able to play the game together! Although a demo in 2026 seems unlikely, 2027 seems to be a realistic target. As I'm the solo developer, the progress on the game depends on me. The struggle to find time for Erios while maintaining a healthy work & family life balance. Fingers crossed!
